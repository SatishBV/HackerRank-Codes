*******SAVE THE PRISONER******

A jail has N prisoners, and each prisoner has a unique id number,S, ranging from 1 to N-1 . There are M sweets that must be
distributed to the prisoners.

The jailer decides the fairest way to do this is by sitting the prisoners down in a circle (ordered by ascending S), and then, starting
with some random S, distribute one candy at a time to each sequentially numbered prisoner until all candies are distributed. For example, if 
the jailer picks prisoner 2, then his distribution order would be 2,3,4......,N-1,N,1,2..... until all sweets are distributed.

But wait—there's a catch—the very last sweet is poisoned! Can you find and print the ID number of the last prisoner to receive a sweet
so he can be warned?
